1. I have implemented a local storage that saves the input message and current 
time. Everything else has been correctly implemented, except that when a user 
tries to return back to the page, the information that was stored in 
LocalStorage prior to existing the page could not be displayed on the page.
However, it is still in LocalStorage. 

2. I didn't collaborate the project with anyone, but I referred to Piazza for 
help.

3. I have spent 5 hours on this assignment.
