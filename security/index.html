	<title>Assignment 4: Security and Privacy Assessment of Assignment 3
	</title>
</head>

<body>
	<h1> Introduction </h1>
	<p> I am hired as a security consultant to document and resolve the 
	security and privacy issues in the applications. The objective is to
	perform a security assessment on a potentially vulnerable web application.
	In this case, the web application is Yishu Huang's Assignment 3, which is
	a 2048 GameCenter that records and displays scores in the 2048 Database. 
	</p>
	<h1> Methodology </h1>
	<p> I have used curl to examine various security leaks in Yishu's
	Assignment 3. My methology to analyzing security issues has been a two
	step process. First, I performed some XSS attack without reading the
	source code, or "black box" testing. Then, I obtained accessed to Yishu's
	source code of the application and was able to perform a manual code
	review, and then go back to the application and attack it. Also known as
	"white box" testing, this step has allowed me to discover problems such as
	a permissive CORS policy. </p>
	<h1> Abstract of Findings </h1>
	<p> I was successfully able to identify three security and/or privacy
	issues. First, the website is susceptible to malicious attacks as anyone
	can modify the contents in the application. Second, the application has a
	security risk where anyone can send a request to the programmer's site and
	steal information. Third, the attacker can easily obtain information of
	everything in the database. </p>
	<h1> Issues Found </h1>
	<h2> 1. Cross Site Scripting </h2>
	<p> The programmer did not handle user input safely.</p>
	<h3> Description of issue </h3>
	<p> I was able to inject an alert box using the script tag.</p>
	<p> curl --data "username=<script>alert(hello!)</script>&score=1&grid=[]"
	</p>
	<p> Specifically, typing this curl command in terminal allows data to be
	entered to a Web application through an untrusted source. In our case, the
	username is intentionally manipulated to include dynamic content without 
	being validated for malicious content. </p>
	<h3> Location where issue was found </h3>
	<p> In POST /submit</p>
	<h3> Severity of issue </h3>
	<p> This issue is high risk because injecting malicious code in the form
	of a browser side script, the script can access any sensitive information
	retained by the browser and used with that site. Even though the alert box
	seems relatively unharmful, if annoying at most, the malicious script can
	rewrite the content of the HTML page and even redirect to another
	irreleant page. Allowing everyone to modify the content of a webpage is
	severe problem. </p>
	<h3> Proof of vulnerability </h3> 
	<p><img src="someimage.jpg" alt="xss_scripting"></p>
	<p> The image shows the alert box after entering the curl command prompt
	in terminal and refreshing the gamecenter webpage.</p>
	<h3> Resolution </h3>
	<p> There are several ways that may help websites prevent XSS from
	happening. The first method is to escape untrusted data before inserting
	into the HTML element content. Specifically, special characters, such as
	the < and > of the script tag, can be prevented with HTML entity encoding
	to prevent switching into execution context. Some of the other significant
	characters in XML can also be replaced with HTML entity encoding. Another
	suggestion is to change the Content-Type header from text/html to
	application/json. This instructs the brower to not misunderstand the
	content and execute injected script. Lastly, a safe JSON serializer is
	helpful because it can remove any embedded script tags and extract only
	the contents. Including require('validator') as part of index.js will
	validate and sanitize input strings. </p>

	<h2> 2. Exploting Permissive CORS Policy </h2>
	<p> The programmer decided to implement the wild card for the server's
	CORS policy. </p>
	<h3> Description of issue. How did you find it? A screenshot of problem is
	excellent. </h3>
	<p> response.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*"); </p>
	<p> This is a security risk because such policy gives any site access the
	server's response. Hence, an attacker can easily send an XHR request to
	the programmer's site and steal valuable information. Allowing access from
	al domains means that any domain can perform two-way interaction with the
	application via this request. Hence, this security risk exposes the
	programmer's site to a "man in the middle" attack. </p>
	<h3> Location or page where issue was found </h3>
	<p> In all three routes, POST /submit, GET /scores.json, and GET / </p>
	<h3> Severity of issue </h3>
	<p> When considering the severity of CORS security risks, we need to
	factor in the degree of vulnearability CORS exposes to the public. In our
	case, the information stored in the database is relative insensitive, thus 
	it is not considered a big issue. However, in the real world, websites
	that contains valuable personal information of users with a CORS security
	leak would result in severe consequences. </p>
	<h3> Proof of vulnerability. </h3> 
	<p> As seen in line 25, 71, and 101 of index.js </p>
	<h3> Resolution </h3>
	<p> One suggestion in addressing this issue is adjusting the wild card to
	only allow resources sharing for selected sites. </p>
	<p>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: (insert url) </p>
	<p> Origin specifies a URL and is allowed to make cross-domain requests. 
	For example, when a site makes a request, <a href="
	https://agile-scrubland-25052.herokuapp.com/">the request page</a>, checks
	if the response header of that site is a permitted request domain. If it
	is an unknown source, the requestd page triggers the XMLHttpRequest error
	event and denies the response data. </p> 
	<h3> Conclusion </h3>
	<p> One possible future consideration is to disable CORS as a whole. Many
	APIS, such as Twitter, Yelp!, FB, do not enable CORS. Instead, get/post
	requests are made from the server-side. </p>

	<h2> 3. Database Injection </h2>
	<p> The programmer did not protect against malicious data aggregation.</p>
	<h3> Description of issue </h3>
	<p> I was able to verify the security risk by searching using query 
	parameters and the $ne operator.</p>
	<p> https://agile-scrubland-25052.herokuapp.com/
	scores.json?username[$ne]=apple </p>
	<p> Specifically, this URL address will display all the scores that do not
	have apple as the username. This is a security risk because attackers can
	provide a specially-crafted input(such as $ne) to take advantage of the
	search query. The attacker has access to data without authorization by
	tricking the database into providing too many results for a query. </p>
	<h3> Location where issue was found </h3>
	<p> In GET /scores.json</p>
	<h3> Severity of issue </h3>
	<p> This issue is high risk because by manipulating the search query, the
	attacker now easily has information of everything in the database. If the
	database was storing more valuable information, for example credit card or
	residential information, this would cause great loss to the company of
	that website. </p>
	<h3> Proof of vulnerability </h3> 
	<p><img src="database_injection.PNG" alt="database injection"></p>
	<p> The image shows the results after searching for all the documents in
	the 2048 Gamecenter database that does not have the username "apple". In 
	this case, all of the information is exposed to the attacker</p>
	<h3> Resolution </h3>
	<p> One suggestion in addressing this issue is to prevent database
	injection vulnerabilities in the first place by usng parameterized
	queries. These types of queries specify placeholders for parameters so
	that the database will treat them as data/string rather than a command.
	Another possible solution is to modify the query string to remove any
	potentially malicious query characters. The programmer may choose to
	implement a sanitize_query() function that modifies the string before the
	query is used to find documents in the database. </p>
	<h3> Conclusion </h3>
	<p> One possible future consideration is to look into the <a href="
	https://github.com/mganss/HtmlSanitizer">HtmlSanitizer .NET library</a>
	that is used for cleaning HTML fragments and document. This build is shown 
	to be passing currently. </p>
