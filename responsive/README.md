1. Testing index.html and responsive.css on the python simple httpserver 8000 
shows that all of the aspects of the assignment have been iplemented correctly.

2. I have discussed the assignment with my classmate in class, Esther Tzau. Eventually I found help on Piazza because other students had a similar problem.  

3. I have spent approximately 5 hours on this assignment. Part of it was spent 
setting up a SSH key because of the error:
"Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository 
exists."
