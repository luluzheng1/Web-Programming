1.	I have implemented the following aspects:

	-Map takes up the entire page
	-Each station has a marker different from Google Map's default marker
	-The map is initially centered on South Station
	-A red polyline connects each station
	-A CSS file is provided
	-The location of each station is hard-coded in JavaScript
	-A separate file is used for JavaScript
	-Determine the user's geolocation and place a marker at the location that
	 is different from the icon of the stations (the default red marker was 
	 used)
	-Map is centered at user's location when geolocation is determined
	-Information window displays the closest station upon clicking on the
	 user's location marker
	-A polyline that connects the user's marker to the closest station
	-Information windows display the arrival time (northbound and southbound)
	 of upcoming trains for the station represented by a marker

2.	I have collaborated with Esther Tzau, another student. We worked on the 
	assignment separately, but discussed any confusions or questions we had 
	together. I used the JavaScript implementation of the Haversine Formula on
	Stack Overflow to calculate the distance between two geopoints.

3.	I have spent approximately 15 hours on this assignment.
